1. Define if Pac-Man eats a ghost
Define the Rules.eat_ghost?/2 function that takes two arguments (if Pac-Man has a power pellet active and if Pac-Man is touching a ghost) and returns a boolean value if Pac-Man is able to eat the ghost. The function should return true only if Pac-Man has a power pellet active and is touching a ghost.

Rules.eat_ghost?(false, true)
# => false
2. Define if Pac-Man scores
Define the Rules.score?/2 function that takes two arguments (if Pac-Man is touching a power pellet and if Pac-Man is touching a dot) and returns a boolean value if Pac-Man scored. The function should return true if Pac-Man is touching a power pellet or a dot.

Rules.score?(true, true)
# => true
3. Define if Pac-Man loses
Define the Rules.lose?/2 function that takes two arguments (if Pac-Man has a power pellet active and if Pac-Man is touching a ghost) and returns a boolean value if Pac-Man loses. The function should return true if Pac-Man is touching a ghost and does not have a power pellet active.

Rules.lose?(false, true)
# => true
4. Define if Pac-Man wins
Define the Rules.win?/3 function that takes three arguments (if Pac-Man has eaten all of the dots, if Pac-Man has a power pellet active, and if Pac-Man is touching a ghost) and returns a boolean value if Pac-Man wins. The function should return true if Pac-Man has eaten all of the dots and has not lost based on the arguments defined in part 3.

Rules.win?(false, true, false)
# => false
